# A generic class

A Java program creates objects representing triples (Triple), where each triple consists of three elements of different types, each implementing the Comparable interface. The program then compares these triples in various ways, using both the Comparable interface and the supplied ReverseTripleComparator.


The concept of generic classes allows code to be written that can handle different data types, leading to more generic, flexible and secure programming.
    In this particular case, generic classes are used to create universal data structures (triples) that can support different element types.
    The class Triple is generic because it allows the types of the three elements in the triple to be specified when using it.
    With this approach, the programmer can create universal data structures and algorithms that are more flexible and reusable.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, you must have IntelliJ or another preferred IDE for Java installed. Configure the IDE for Java, translate the code into machine language i.e. compile it, and then run the program.
